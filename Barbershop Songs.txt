Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello there
"Hello, ma Baby
Hello, ma honey
Hello, ma ragtime pal
Send me a kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire, and
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Oh baby, telephone
And tell me you're my own
Hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
I've got a little baby, but he's out of sight
I talk to him across the telephone, telephone
I've never seen ma honey, but he's mine, all right
So take my tip, and leave this guy alone
And I'll sing
"Hello, ma Baby
Hello, ma honey
Hello, ma ragtime pal
Send me a kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Baby, telephone
And tell me you're my own
Hello, hello, hello
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Baby, telephone
And tell me you're my own
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Tell me you're my own

If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song
Of a flower that's now dropped and dead,
Yet dearer to me, yes than all of its mates,
Though each holds aloft its proud head.
Twas given to me by a girl that I know,
Since we've met, faith I've known no repose.
She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star,
And I call her my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
They may sing of their rose, which by other names,
Would smell just as sweetly, they say.
But I know that my Rose would never consent
To have that sweet name taken away.
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
The bower where my true love grows,
And my one wish has been that some day I may win
The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.

On a Sunday morn sat a maid forlorn
With her sweetheart by her side,
Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain,
"We must stay home, Joe," she cried.
"There's a picnic, too, at the old Point View,
It's a shame it rained today."
Then the boy drew near, kissed away each tear,
And she heard him softly say:
"Wait till the sun shines, Nellie,
When the clouds go drifting by,
We will be happy, Nellie,
Don't you sigh.
Down Lover's Lane we'll wander,
Sweethearts you and I.
Wait till the sun shines, Nellie,
Bye and bye."
"How I long," she sighed, "for a trolley ride
Just to show my brand new gown."
Then she gazed on high with a gladsome cry
For the sun came shining down.
And she looked so sweet on the big front seat
As the car sped on its way,
And she whispered low,
"Say you're all right, Joe,
You just won my heart today."

Last night alone,
on our way home,
you turned and said to me:
"I love you so,
and I want to know,
What do you think about me?"
Sweet and lovely, 
that's what you are to me.
Sugar and spice
and everything nice;
You're all a girl should be.
Soon we'll marry,
You'll be my blushing bride.
I will smile all the while you're by my side.
I will smile all the while you're by my side.

Down our way
Both night and day
You know ev'ry body
And they all know you
And even policemen say 
'How do you do?'
Pals by the score
And gals galore
And that old gang of mine
They sang Sweet Adeline
Down our way
Down our way

Oh, 
honey, honey,
bless your heart,
Oh, honey that I love so well.
I've done been true, 
my gal to you,
You're the honey that I love so well.
Little 'Lize,
I love you,
Little 'Lize,
I love you,
Love you in the spring and in the fall.
Little 'Lize,
I love you,
Little 'Lize,
I love you,
Love you best of all.
Honey that I love so well.

I am dreaming Dear of you, day by day
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray
When the silv'ry moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Longing for you all the while, More and more;
Longing for the sunny smile, I adore
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true
Let me call you "Sweetheart," I'm in love with you

Sweet, sweet roses of morn,
You're the ideal of my dreams;
My heart's all in a whirl,
I could love you forever, it seems. 
Like a fashion plate on Broadway; 
You came out with the sun's first gleam;
Sweet, sweet roses of morn, 
You're the ideal of my dreams.
Like a fashion plate on Broadway; 
You came out with the sun's first gleam;
Sweet, sweet roses of morn, 
You're the ideal of my dreams.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto me and rest.
Lay down thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon my breast.”
Shine on me, Shine on me.
Let the light from the lighthouse,
Shine on me.
Shine on me. Shine on me.
Let the light from the lighthouse
shine on me.
With pitying eyes the Prince of Peace
Beheld our helpless grief;
He saw, and O amazing love!
He came to our relief.
Shine on me, Shine on me.
Let the light from the lighthouse,
Shine on me.
Shine on me. Shine on me.
Let the light from the lighthouse
shine on me.

A youth one day in a garden fair
A rose found withered and dying,
And all for love, ah! love in vain
This rose was sadly sighing.:
Heart of my heart, I love you,
Life would be naught without you;
Light of my life, my darling,
I love you, I love you.
I can forget you never,
From you I ne'er can sever.
Say you'll be mine for ever,
I love you.
Oh, sweet wild rose of a summer day,
Thy love has all been in vain;
Loved by a maid, then cast away,
I echo thy refrain.
Heart of my heart, I love you,
Life would be naught without you;
Light of my life, my darling,
I love you, I love you.
I can forget you never,
From you I ne'er can sever.
Say you'll be mine for ever,
I love you.

In the evening when I sit alone a-dreaming
Of days gone by, love, to me so dear,
There's a picture that in fancy oft' appearing,
Brings back the time, love, when you were near.
It is then I wonder where you are, my darling,
And if your heart to me is still the same.
For the sighing wind and nightingale a-singing
Are breathing only your own sweet name.
Sweet Adeline, (My Adeline,)
My Adeline, (My Adeline,)
At night, dear heart, (At night, dear heart,)
For you I pine. (For you I pine.)
In all my dreams, (In all my dreams,)
Your fair face beams. (Your fair face beams.)
You're the flower of my heart,
Sweet Adeline. (My Adeline.)

Down by the old mill stream where I first met you, 
With your eyes of blue, dressed in gingham too,
It was there I knew that you loved me true,
You were sixteen, my village queen, by the old mill stream.
My darling I am dreaming of the days gone by,
When you and I were sweethearts beneath the summer sky;
Your hair has turned to silver, the gold has faded too;
But still I will remember, where I first met you.
Down by the old mill stream where I first met you, 
With your eyes of blue, dressed in gingham too,
It was there I knew that you loved me true,
You were sixteen, my village queen, by the old mill stream.
The old mill wheel is silent and has fallen down,
The old oak tree has withered and lies there on the ground;
While you and I are sweethearts the same as days of yore;
Although we've been together, forty years and more.
Down by the old mill stream where I first met you, 
With your eyes of blue, dressed in gingham too,
It was there I knew that you loved me true,
You were sixteen, my village queen, by the old mill stream.

You had a dream dear I had one too
Mine was the best dream because it was of you
Come sweetheart tell me now is the time
You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine.
You had a dream dear I had one too
Mine was the best dream because it was of you
Come sweetheart tell me now is the time
You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine.
You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine.

Give me your hand to hold in mine, 
and I will give you my heart.

Ring, ring the banjo!
Hey, get along, Jim along Joe!
Get out the way for old Dan Tucker,
Camptown ladies sing this song,

With my banjo doo-dah day!

Camptown ladies sing dis song, Doo-dah! doo-dah!
Camptown race-track five miles long, Oh, doo-dah day!

Gwine to run all night!

Dear Old Girl, the robin sings above you,
Dear Old Girl, it speaks of how I love you,
The blinding tears are falling,
As I think of my lost pearl,
And my broken heart is calling,
Calling for you,
Dear Old Girl.

I'll be there
Honey wait for me
Oh you darlin'
Down among the sheltering palms
Down among the Sheltering palms
Honey wait for me
Honey wait for me
Keeping waitin' for me
Knee deep down by the old Golden Gate, mmm
Out where the sun goes down about eight
How my love is burnin' burnin' burnin'
How my heart is yearnin' yearnin' yearin'
To be down among the sheltering palms
Honey wait for me
I'm lonely
Sweetheart I'm oh so lonely
Just thinking, just thinking of you only
My life's been dreary
Darling, oh so dreary
When we parted my life started
Started into be nothin' but the blues
Oh, oh I want you
I always want you near me
I need you
I need you can't you hear me?
Night time is fallin'
My heart keeps on callin'
Honey, darlin' won't you wait for me, oh
Honey, wait for me
Down 'neath the palms
I'll be there
Honey wait for me
Oh you darlin'
Down among the sheltering palms

Maybe you'll think of me
When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe
May be you'll think of me
When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe

You made me what I am today, I hope you're satisfied
You dragged and dragged me down until the soul within me died
You've shattered each and every dream, fooled me right from the start
And though you're not true, may God bless you
That's the curse of an aching heart
You made me what I am today, I should hope you're satisfied
You dragged, you dragged me down until the soul within me died
You've shattered each and every dream, you fooled me right from the start
And although you're not true, may God bless you
That's the curse of an aching heart

I'll be round to get you in a taxi, honey
Pick you up 'bout half past eight
Oh honey don't be late
I want to be there when the band starts playin'
Remember when we get there, honey
Two step, we're gonna have a ball
I'm gonna dance out of my shoes
When they play the Jelly Roll Blues
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's Ball
Got my new threads ready
And they're really something
With you in yours we'll look a smash
We're gonna make a splash
And when the band starts playin'
Baby we'll start swayin'
Remember when we get there honey
We're gonna dance the night away
And things are gonna hit the roof
When they see the way you move
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's Ball
I'll be down to get you in a taxi, honey
Pick you up 'bout half past eight
Oh honey don't be late
I want to be there when the band starts playin'
Remember when we get there honey
Two step, we're gonna have a ball
I'm gonna dance out of my shoes
When they play the Back Street Blues
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's
Tomorrow night at the Darktown Strutter's Ball

When the moon comes over the mountain
Every beam brings a dream, dear, of you
Once again we'll stroll 'neath the mountain
Through that rose-covered valley we knew
Each day is grey and dreary
But the night is bright and cheery
When the moon comes over the mountain
I'll be alone with my memories of you

I sometimes wish I was a kid again
Down in the old neighborhood
Just to be with Charlie, with little Joe and Pete
Boy, we had a quartette that was mighty hard to beat
I'd love to stand down by that cellar door
Just to hear that quartette sing once more
"Heart Of My Heart", I love that melody
"Heart Of My Heart" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
"Heart Of My Heart"
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang "Heart Of My Heart"
"Heart Of My Heart", I love that melody
"Heart Of My Heart" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
"Heart Of My Heart"
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang "Heart Of My Heart"

I'll see you in my dreams
And then I'll hold you in my dreams
Someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms
Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams
Yes I will... see you in my dreams
You know I'll... hold you in my dreams
I know that... someone took you right out of my arms
But... still I feel the thrill of your charms
I dream of... lips that once were mine
And those... tender eyes that shine
I know... they'll light my way tonight
When I... see you in my dreams
Yes they will... light my way tonight
Because I'll... see you in my dreams

I’ve often heard my daddy speak of Ireland’s lakes and dells
The place must be like Heaven, if it’s half like what he tells
There’s roses fair and shamrocks there, and laughing waters flow
I have never seen that Isle of Green, but there’s one thing sure, I know
Ireland must be heaven, for an angel came from there
I never knew a living soul one half as sweet or fair
For her eyes are like the starlight and the white clouds match her hair
Sure Ireland must be Heaven, for my mother came from there
I’ve pictured in my fondest dreams old Ireland’s vales and rills
I see a stairway to the sky, formed by her verdant hills
Each wave that’s in the ocean blue just loves to hug the shore
So if Ireland isn’t Heaven, then sure, it must be right next door

M--is for the million things she gave me
0 -- means only that shes getting older
T--is for the tears she shed to save me
H-- is for her heart of purest gold
E-- is for her eyes with love light shining
R-- means right and right she'll always be
Put them all together they spell mother
A word that means the world to me.


She was a child of the valley
An innocent maiden was she
He was a desperate Desmond
Who owned all the town property
He would pursue her through hills and through dells
But she was wise to his game
Each time he threatened, "You'll wed me or else"
These were the words she'd exclaim....
"No! No! A thousand times no!
You cannot buy my caress!
No! No! A thousand times no!
I'd rather die than say yes"
Ah, but this poisonous villain
He wouldn't leave her alone
He said, "Either join me in wedlock
Or I'll kick you out of your home"
She knew her people so feeble and old
Needed a roof o'er their heads
Winter would soon bring the snow and the cold
Yet she defied him and said....
"No! No! A thousand times no!
You cannot buy my caress!
No! No! A thousand times no!
I'd rather die than say yes"
That night he crept up to her window
And oh, how that villain could creep
He stole her out of her boudoir
And kidnapped her while fast asleep
He tied the gal to the old railroad track
The milk train was rushing down the hill
She cried to him, "Though my future looks black
You buzzard, my answer is still....
"No! No! A thousand times no!
You cannot buy my caress!
No! No! A thousand times no!
I'd rather die than say yes"
Now she loved the young village blacksmith
A muscular "he-man" was he
He heard that his love was in danger
And right to the rescue flew he
He grabbed his darling in "thee" nick of time
And yelled, "This is my future wife!"
The villain sneered, "Blacksmith, that maiden is mine!"
The hero cried, "Not on your life!"....
"No! No! A thousand times no!
You cannot buy her caress!
No! No! A thousand times no!
She'd rather die than say yes"
Now this is the end of our story
Her honour was left without stain
The hero took her to the altar
The villain was foiled once again
The mortgage was paid and the handsome young swain
Moved in with her folks right away
Their life is contented though simple and plain
And no more will she have to say....
"No! No! A thousand times no!
You cannot buy my caress!
No! No! A thousand times no!
I'd rather die than say yes"

Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four
Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?
Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'
Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.
Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'
Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

I met you in a garden in an old Kentucky town
The sun was shining down
You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip
And I wore a big red rose

If we can't be the same old sweethearts,
Then we'll just be the same old friends!
For I want someone like you
Just to tell my troubles to,
My happiness, on you,
It all depends!
For I've known you too long to forget you
And my old dream of love never ends!
Though I know you can't be mine,
We will meet from time to time
And we'll just be the same old friends!
For I've known you too long to forget you
And my old dream of love never ends!
Though I know you can't be mine,
We will meet from time to time
And we'll just be the same old friends!

I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore,
And maybe I've learned this time.
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for,
The way that it is in my mind.
Someday I'll get over you.
I'll live to see it all through.
But I'll always miss,
Dreaming my dreams with you.
But I won't let it change me,
Not if I can.
I'd rather believe in love.
And give it away as much as I can,
To those that I'm fondest of.
Someday I'll get over you.
I'll live to see it all through.
But I'll always miss,
Dreaming my dreams with you.
Someday I'll get over you.
I'll live to see it all through.
But I'll always miss,
Dreaming my dreams with you.

Jimmy was a soldier brave and bold,
Katy was a maid with hair of gold,
Like an act of fate,
Kate was standing at the gate,
Watching all the boys on dress parade.
Kate smiled, with a twinkle in her eye,
Jim said m-m-meet you by and by.
That same night at eight,
Jim was at the garden gate,
Stuttering this song to K-K-Kate...
K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy,
You're the only g-g-g-girl that I adore;
When the m-m-m-moon shines,
Over the cowshed,
I'll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.
K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy,
You're the only g-g-g-girl that I adore;
When the m-m-m-m-moon shines,
Over the cowshed,
I'll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.
No one ever looked so nice and neat,
No one could be just as cute and sweet,
That's what Jimmy thought,
When the wedding ring he bought,
Now he's off to France the foe to meet.
Jimmy thought he'd like to take a chance,
See if he could make the Kaiser dance,
Stepping to a tune,
All about the silv'ry moon,
This is what they hear in far off France...
K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy,
You're the only g-g-g-girl that I adore;
When the m-m-m-moon shines,
Over the cowshed,
I'll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.
K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy,
You're the only g-g-g-girl that I adore;
When the m-m-m-moon shines,
Over the cowshed,
I'll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door.

Jeannine, I dream of lilac time
Your eyes, they beam in the lilac time
Your winning smile
And cheeks blushing like the rose
Yet all the while, you sigh when nobody knows
Jeannine, my queen of lilac times
When I return, I'll make you mine
For you and I, our love dream can never die

I'm sitting on top of the world,
I'm rolling along,
I'mrolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song,
Just singing a song.
Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson,
Hey, par, get ready to call.'
Just like humpty dumpty,
I'm going to fall.
I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along,
Just rolling along.'
Some people have diamonds
And beautiful pearls,
While others have children,
Just kiddies with curls.
Keep all of your fortunes,
Keep all of your fame,
I just found a sweetie
Who's changing her name.
I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along,
Just rolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song,
Just singing a song.
Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson,
Hey, par, get ready to call.'
Just like humpty dumpty,
I'm going to fall.
I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along,
Just rolling along.'
Don't want any millions,
I'm getting my share.
I've only got one suit,
That's all i can wear.
A bundle of money won't make you feel gay.
A sweet little honey is making me say:
I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along,
Just rolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song,
Just singing a song.
Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson,
Hey, par, get ready to call.'
Just like humpty dumpty,
I'm going to fall.
I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along,
Just rolling along.

Mary o' mine, Mary o' mine, 
Grew like a rose in a bower,
Bloomed for a day, 
Faded away, 
I lost a beautiful flower;
Sweetheart and friend, right to the end; 
That's why I miss her so.
Mary o' mine, Mary o' mine, 
My little playmate of childhood,
Symbol of love, 
Sent from above, 
Staunch as an oak in the wildwood; 
Mem'ries of old, purer than gold; 
Fill me with love sublime.
Oh! what a gal was Mary, 
Oh! what a pal was she, 
An angel was born on Easter morn, 
and God sent her down to me. 
Heart of my heart was Mary, 
Soul of my soul divine, 
Though she is gone, love lingers on, 
for Mary old pal of mine.

Roll along prairie moon, roll along while I croon
Shine above lamp of love, prairie moon
Way up there in the blue maybe you're lonely, too
Swinging by in the sky, prairie moon
I need your tender light to make things right
You know I'm all alone tonight
Far away shed your beams on the girl of my dreams
Tell her too I've been true, prairie moon
There's a wonderful light in the sky tonight
With silver the hills are sprayed
And the moon seems so near that I know it will hear
Every word of my love serenade
Roll along prairie moon, roll along while I croon
Shine above lamp of love, prairie moon
Way up there in the blue maybe you're lonely, too
Swinging by in the sky, prairie moon
I need your tender light to make things right
You know I'm so alone tonight
Far away shed your beams on the girl of my dreams
Tell her too I've been true, prairie moon

When the nightingale's singing its sweet melodies, 
And the scent of the flowers perfumes the night breeze, 
Then I dream of my old home far over the sea, 
By the Lake of Kilarney, 
Where I long to be. 
And I see you, it seems, waiting there on the shore,
Where together we stray'd in the sweet days of yore, 
I am thinking, tonight, of my Colleen so true: 
When I dream of Old Erin, I'm dreaming of you.
I can see the old cottage, just o'er the hill there; 
'Tis those fond recollections bring happiness rare. 
Sure the lassie I love with a heart that is true, 
She is waiting for someone, 
While someone waits too. 
And my love's growing stronger each day, more and more, 
'Tis the same old love story that's told o'er and o'er, 
So, -cush-la my Colleen, it seems that you knew, 
When I dream of Old Erin, I'm dreaming of you.
When I dream of old Erin I'm dreaming of you, 
With your sweet, roguish smile and your true eyes of blue; 
For my love, like the Shamrock, each day stronger grew; 
When I dream of Old Erin, I'm dreaming of you.

Sometimes when someone needs something, something to make someone glad, 
why couldn't something help someone, Why should that someone be sad? 
You are the something I mean, dear, I am the someone so blue, 
Love is so hard to explain dear, I only know that I need you.
Something could change someone's world, dear, Something could brighten the sky, 
something could make someone happy, if something only would try. 
Someone is waiting and hoping, hoping to have someone near, 
I am the someone, who's waiting, you are the something so dear.
Like the roses need their fragrance, like a sweetheart needs a kiss, 
like the summer needs the sunshine, like a laddie needs a miss; 
like a broken heart needs gladness, like the flowers need the dew, 
like a baby needs its mother, that's how I need you.

Katie O’ Connor from Tenth Avenue,
was dancing with Francis her beau,
And after they finished a Lounge Lizard said,
“Will you dance with me ’fore you go?”
But Kate said, “If I’m gonna dance,
There’s only one guy stands a chance.”
“When Francis dances with me, Hully Gee,
I’m as gay as can be,
He takes me to dances ’cause that’s what I love,
I fit in his arms like a motorman’s glove,
Oh, the Bow’ry, the Bow’ry,
we don’t go there any more,
He wears a Tuxedo and Gee, how it fits,
He looks like the Headwaiter up at the Ritz,
and I wears a gown that’s got twenty-eight slits,
When Francis dances with me.”
Katie says “Sometimes I’m lonesome and blue,
and sometimes my head starts to ache,
And sometimes my corns pop or I catch a cold,
I feel like my back wants to break.
And if I should fall on my ear,
The pain sure would soon disappear.”
“When Francis danced with me, Hully Gee,
I’m as gay as can be,
When we start in waltzing with Heaven I flirt,
He steps on my toes but they don’t seem to hurt,
Oh, the Bow’ry, the Bow’ry, we don’t go there any more,
His hair shines like diamonds, he combs it with fat,
He wears a Palm Beach and a brown derby hat,
now you know a guy can’t look better than that,
When Francis dances with me.”

Sunbeams are gently fading, slowly fading,
And birds are waiting to do their mating,
When eventide is nigh, moonbeams are descending,
The day is ending, a happy ending,
The sun is sinking below the western sky.
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.
Daydreams through fields of clover, will soon be over,
And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,
Sweet dreams have just begun, dear, the day is done, dear,
When skies grow dimmer,
And stars will glimmer along the starlit way.
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.

Day is ending
Birds are wending
Back to the shelter of
Each little nest they love
Nightshades falling
Lovebirds calling
What makes the world go round?
Nothing but love
When Whip-poor-wills call
And ev'ning is nigh
I hurry to
My blue heaven
I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to
My blue heaven
You'll see a smiling face,
A fireplace,
A cozy room
A little nest
That's nestled where
The roses bloom
Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in
My blue heaven
Doo doo doo doo doo
Da da da da da
You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace,
A cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in
My blue heaven
We're happy in my blue heaven

Oh, I got a gal and she is a daisy.
Got all the boys in our town plumb crazy.
With your sticks and your stones
you can break all my bones,
say what you want about me when I'm gone.
I'm gonna live every day until I tee idle dum dum die!
Oh, I got a gal and she is a daisy.
Got all the boys in our town plumb crazy.
I will sail off for France
I won't take any chance.
I know she's got me deep in a trance.
I want to be with her until I tee idle dum dum die!

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more that I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more that I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for
The longest time

Passed me by one summer day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oh I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before
I said "Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou
We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou
Goodbye heart"
Saw your lips, I heard your voice
believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
Thought about a moonlit night
Arms about good and tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
To get the sun back in the sky
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
About a thousand kisses shy
Ding dong ding
I can hear the chapel bell chime
Ding dong ding
At the least suggestion
I'll pop the question
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose
Without a sweetheart to my name
Lida Rose, now everyone knows
That I am hoping you're the same
So here is my love song
Not fancy or fine
Lida Rose, oh won't you be....
Mine, Lida Rose, oh Lida Rose,
Oh Lida Rose...
Dream of now
Dream of then
Dream of a love song
That might have been
Do I love you?
Oh yes, I love you
And I'll bravely tell you
But only when we dream again
Sweet and low
Sweet and low
How sweet that mem'ry
How long ago
Forever
Oh yes, forever
Will I ever tell you?
Oh no.

Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone, blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
'Cause I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
I remember that night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
So before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
In the still of the night

Istanbul was Constantinople
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Still a Turkish delight on a moonlit night
Every gal in Constantinople
Is a  Misstanbul, not Constantinople
So if you've a date in Constantinople
She'll be waiting in Istanbul
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it I can't say
People just liked it better that way
Take me back to Constantinople
No, you can't go back to Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks

Goodbye My Coney Island Baby
Farewell my own true love.
I'm gonna go away and leave you.
Never to see you anymore.
I'm goin' to sail up on a ferry boat,
Never to return again.
So goodbye, farewell, so long for ever,
Goodbye My Coney Isle,
Goodbye My Coney Isle,
Goodbye My Coney Island...
Goodbye My Coney Island Baby
Farewell my own true love.
I'm gonna go away and leave you.
Never to see you anymore.
I'm goin' to sail up on a ferry boat,
Never to return again.
So goodbye, farewell, so long for ever,
Goodbye My Coney Isle,
Goodbye My Coney Isle,
Goodbye My Coney Island Baby

When it's darkness on the delta
That's the time my heart is light
When it's darkness on the delta
Let me linger in the shelter of the night
Fields of cotton all around me
Voices singin' sweet and low
Lord, I'm lucky that you found me
Where the muddy Mississippi waters flow
Lounging on the levee
Listenin' to the nightingales way up above
Laughter on the levee
No one's heart is heavy
All God's children got someone to love
When it's darkness on the delta
Only heaven is in sight
When it's darkness on the delta
Let me linger in the shelter of the night

She's real fine my 409
Well I saved my pennies and I saved my dimes
For I knew there would be a time
When I would buy a brand new 409
Giddy up giddy up giddy up 409
Giddy up 409
Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409
When I take her to the track she really shines
She always runs in the fastest times
Nothing can catch her
Nothing can touch my 409
My four speed dual quad posi-traction 409
Giddy up giddy up giddy up 409

Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
I hate to leave you, but I really must say,
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.
Well, it's three o'clock in the morning,
Baby, I just can't do right,
Well, I hate to leave you, baby,
I don't mean maybe, you know I love you so.
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
I hate to leave you, but I really must say,
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.
Well your mother and your father,
Might hear if I stay here too long
So a kiss and we'll part
And I'll be going, you know I hate to go.
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
I hate to leave you, but I really must say,
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.

Oh we ain't got a barrel of money 
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along
Singing a song side by side
Don't know what's coming tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road
Sharing our load side by side
Through all kinds of weather 
What if the sky should fall? 
Just as long as we're together
It doesn't matter at all
When they've all had their quarrels and parted 
We'll be the same as we started 
Just traveling along
Singing our song side by side

While strolling through the park one day
It was in the merry merry month of May
I was taken by surprise
By a pair of roguish eyes
In a moment my poor heart was stole away
A smile was all she gave to me
[soft-shoe break]
Of course we were as happy as can be
[soft-shoe break]
I immediately raised my hat
And finally she remarked
I never shall forget
That lovely afternoon
I met her at the fountain in the park

Well, love, love me darlin'
Come and go with me,
Please don't send me
Way beyong the sea;
I need you darlin'
So come go with me.
Come, come, come, come,
Come into my heart,
Tell me darlin'
We will never part;
I need you darlin'
So come go with me.
Yes I need you,
Yes I really need you,
Please say you'll never leave me.
Well, say you'll never,
Yes you'll really never,
You never give me a chance. (wop wop)
Come, come, come, come,
Come into my heart,
Tell me darlin'
We will never part;
I need you darlin'
So come go with me
Come on go with me...

May the road rise to meet you
May the wind be always at your back
May the sun shine warm upon your face
May the rains fall soft upon your fields 
And until we meet again, 
May He hold you in His hand
May God hold you in the palm of His hand
Hold you in the palm of His hand

Though April showers may come your way
They bring the flowers that bloom in May
So if it's raining, have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know, it's raining violets
And where you see clouds upon the hill
You soon will see crowds of daffodills
So keep on looking for a bluebird
You can listen to his song
Whenever April showers come along

I'd like to find a girl just like the girl
Who married my dear old dad
When I was a boy my mother often said to me
Get married boy and see how happy you will be (ho ho ho)
I have looked all over, but no girlie can I find,
Who seems to be just like the little girl I have in mind,
I will have to look around until the right one I have found.
I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad
She was a pearl and the only girl that Daddy ever had,
A good old fashioned girl with heart so true,
One who loves nobody else but you,
I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad.

Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say "love"
C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
I don't wanna sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, whoah yeah, why do you make me blue
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

A small cafe, Mam'selle
A rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by, a kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does
No heart ever yearned as much as mine does for you
And yet I know too well
Some day you'll say goodbye
Then violins will cry
And so will I, Mam'selle

Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells Here we go!
Like reindeer in the sky
You can fly! You can fly!
You can fly! You can fly!
Up you go with a high and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Neverland waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye
You can fly! You can fly!
You can fly! You can fly!
You can fly! You can fly!
You can fly! You can fly!

Happy birthday, a great big to do

Happy birthday from us to you

So here's a wish: one, two, three, four part harmony
Happy Birthday, your special day, to you

Daisy, Daisy give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
On the seat of a bicycle built for two
You will look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle
No gas bill to pay, no oats or hay
We'll just pedal away on a bicycle built for two

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there

It's a long way to Tipperary,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye, Piccadilly,
Farewell, Leicester Square!
It's a long long way to Tipperary,
And my heart's right there. 

I love the coolness of the water
I love the softness of the shore
Someday I know that I will go
Homeward, that's where I long to be
The fish are jumping from the river
The birds are graceful as they soar
I know that they want me today
River I hear you calling me to
Swanee, How I love you, how I love you
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be
Among the folks in
D-I-X-I-E-ven now My mammy's 
Waiting for me
Praying for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north will see me no more
When I go to the Swanee Shore
I've been away from you a long time
I never thought I'd missed you so
Somehow I feel
You love is real
Near you I long to/wanna be
The birds are singing it is song time
The banjos strumming soft and low
I know that you yearn for me too
Swanee, you're calling me
I hear you

They say it's your birthday
It's my birthday too, yeah
They say it's your birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you
Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party
Yes we're going to a party party
I would like you to dance (Birthday)
Take a cha-cha-cha-chance (Birthday)
I would like you to dance (Birthday)

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving ooh
All my loving I will send to you

Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Every morning you greet me
Small and white clean and bright
You look happy to meet me
Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever.

Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh, Your daddy's rich
And your ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
One of these mornings, one of these days
You're going to rise up singing (praise the Lord)
You're gonna spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But until that day
There's a'nothing can harm you
So hush little baby don't you cry

When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do
If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how bad we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do
The young have problems, many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us, try and help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart
Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do
No it isn't very pretty what a town without pity
Can do

Ooga-chaka ooga-ooga
Ooga-chaka ooga-ooga
I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me
When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's alright
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
Lips as sweet as candy
Its taste is on my mind
Girl, you got me thirsty
For another cup of wine
Got a bug from you, girl
But I don't need no cure
I'll just stay a victim
If I can for sure
All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up, girl
Yeah, you turn me on
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

Let there be peace on Earth
And let it begin with me
Let there be peace on Earth
The peace that was meant to be
With God as our Father
Brothers all are we
Let me walk with my brothers
In perfect harmony
Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now
With every step I take
Let this be my solemn vow
To take each moment
And live each moment
With peace eternally
Let there be peace on Earth
And let it begin with me

Take me out to the ball game,
Take me out with the crowd.
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,
I don't care if I never get back,
Let me root, root, root for the home team,
If they don't win it's a shame.
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
At the old ball game.

There's a time in each year
That we always hold dear,
Good old summer time.
With the birds in the trees'es
And sweet scented breezes,
Good old summer time.
When your day's work is over
Then you are in clover,
And life is one beautiful rhyme.
No trouble annoying,
Each one is enjoying,
The good old summer time.
In the good old summer time,
In the good old summer time,
Strolling through the shady lanes
With my baby mine.
You hold her hand and she holds yours
And that's a very good sign
That she's your tootsie wootsie
In the good old summer time. 
In the good old summer time!

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

The night is new my dear sweetheart
And you and I are young
But no pale moonlight or star so bright
Are lovely as you tonight
Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.
You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.
With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart.
Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you, just the way you look tonight.

Sometimes in our lives 
We all have pain 
We all have sorrow 
But if we are wise 
We know that there's always tomorrow 
Lean on me, when you're not strong 
And I'll be your friend 
I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
'Til I'm gonna need 
Somebody to lean on
You just call on me sister, when you need a hand (Chorus)
We all need somebody to lean on 
I just might have a problem that you'd understand 
We all need somebody to lean on
If there is a load you have to bear 
That you can't carry 
I'm right up the road 
I'll share your load 
If you just call me
(Chorus)
Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me (call me)
Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me (if you ever need a friend)
Call me (call me)
Call me 
Call me (if you need a friend)

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon,
To my honey I'll croon love's tune.
Honey moon, keep shining in June.
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams,
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon. 

There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more 

How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
How do you do what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
You give me a feeling in my heart
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
You give me a feeling in my heart, ooh-la-la
Like an arrow passing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
Wish I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

Oh baby mine, be mine
Oh baby mine, be mine
Oh baby mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you
Can't do without you, that's why I dream about you
If I could only put my arms about you
Life would be so fair
We two could hug and kiss and never tire
I'm on fire, you are my one desire
I get so lonely when I dream about you,
Why can't you be there?
I'm always tossing and turning in my slumber
Holding you, it seems
And that's when give you kisses without number,
But only in my dreams
Oh baby mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you
Can't do without you, that's why I dream about you
If I could only put my arms about you
Life would be so fair (baby mine)
Life would be so fair

What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon
the sun was gonna shine.
And she was right,
this love of mine,
My Valentine
As days and nights,
would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared,
a love so fine,
My Valentine
And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
without remembering the reasons why
she makes me certain
that I can fly
And so I do,
without a care
I know that someday soon the sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine
My Valentine

First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide?
At last, we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine
In the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web
Of your love

Sweet Rosie O'Grady,
My dear little Rrose,
She's my steady lady,
Most ev'ryone knows.
And, when we are married,
How happy we'll be;
I love sweet Rosie O'Grady,
And Rosie O'Grady loves me.

While strolling through the park one day
It was in the merry merry month of May
I was taken by surprise
By a pair of roguish eyes
In a moment my poor heart was stole away
A smile was all she gave to me
[soft-shoe break]
Of course we were as happy as can be
[soft-shoe break]
I immediately raised my hat
And finally she remarked
I never shall forget
That lovely afternoon
I met her at the fountain in the park

Everybody wants to be a cat,
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at.
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat,
Cause everything else is obsolete.
A square with a horn,
Makes you wish you weren't born,
Everytime he plays.
And with a square in the act,
You can set music back
To the caveman days.
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing,
But still a cat's the only cat
Who knows how to swing.
Who wants to dig
A long-haired gig
And stuff like that?
When everybody wants to be a cat.
A square with a horn,
Makes you wish you weren't born,
Everytime he plays;
But with a square in the act,
You can set music back
To the caveman days.
Everybody wants to be a cat,
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at.
When playin' jazz you always has a Welcome mat.
Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat!

Days can be sunny,
With never a sigh ;
Don't need what money can buy.
Birds in the tree sing
Their dayful of song,
Why shouldn't we sing along?
I'm chipper all the day,
Happy with my lot.
How do I get that way?
Look at what I've got :
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my gal
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Ol'Man Trouble,
I don't mind him.
You won't find him
'Round my door.
I got starlight,
I got sweet dreams,
I got my gal,
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my gal
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my gal
Who could ask for anything more?

Baby on board
How I've adored
That sign on my car's windowpane.
Bounce in my step,
Loaded with pep,
'Cause I'm driving in the carpool lane.
Call me a square,
Friend I don't care,
That little yellow sign can't be ignored.
I'm telling you it's mighty nice.
Each trip's a trip to paradise
With my baby on board.

Carolina Moon keep shining 
shining on the one who waits for me 
Carolina Moon, I'm pining,
pining for the place I long to be 
How I'm hopin' tonight you'll go 
go to the right window 
scatter your light 
say I'm all right please do!
Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely 
dreamy Carolina Moon!

It's you in the sunrise, 
It's you in my cup, 
It's you all the way into town. 
It's your sweet "hello", dear, that sets me up, 
And it's your "got to go", dear, that gets me down. 
It's you on my pillow, 
In all of my dreams, 
Till once more the morning breaks through, 
What words could be saner, or truer, or plainer, 
Than it's you, 
It's you, 
Yes it's you, 
Oh yes, it's you.

What would you do if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ear and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I sing high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.
What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
How do I feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, sing high with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna to try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know she's mine.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, I sing high with a little help from my friends,
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Ooh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
with a little help from my friends

Voices hum, crooning over Moonlight Bay.
Banjos strum, tuning while the moonbeams play.
All alone, unknown, they find me
Memories like these remind me
Of the girl I left behind me
Down on Moonlight Bay.
We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay.
We could hear the voices ringing they seemed to say:
"You have stolen my heart, now don't go away"
Just as we sang love's old sweet songs on Moonlight Bay.

Oh! you beautiful doll,
You great big beautiful doll!
Let me put my arms about you,
I could never live without you;
Oh! you beautiful doll,
You great big beautiful doll!
If you ever leave me how my heart will ache,
I want to hug you but I fear you'd break
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, you beautiful doll! 

I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along
Just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song
Just singing a song
Glory hallelujah, I just phoned the parson
Hey, par, get ready to call
Just like humpty dumpty,
I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along
Just rolling along

Somebody loves me, I wonder who,
I wonder who she can be.
Somebody loves me, I wish I knew,
Who she can be worries me.
For ev'ry girl who passes me I shout,
"Hey, maybe
You were meant to be my lovin' baby."
Somebody loves me, I wonder who,
Maybe it's you.

When I get older, losing my hair,
Many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

Peg O' My Heart, I love you
Don't let us part, I love you
I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter,
It's your Irish hear I'm after.
Peg O' My Heart, your glances
Make my heart say: "How's chances?"
Come be my own, come make your home in my heart.
Just a dream of love...
Peg O' My Heart, I love you
Don't let us part, I love you
I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter,
It's your Irish hear I'm after.
Peg O' My Heart, your glances
Make my heart say: How's chances?
Come be my own, come make your home in my heart.
In my heart!

As the blackbird in the spring
'Neath the willow tree
Sat and piped
I heard him sing
praising Aura Lee.
Aura Lee! Aura Lee!
Maid of golden hair
sunshine came along with thee
And swallows in the air.

How can there be any sin in sincere
Where is the good in goodbye?
Your apprehensions confuse me dear
Puzzle and mystify (Mystify)
Tell me what can be fair in farewell, dear
While one single star shines above
How can there be any sin in sincere?
Aren't we sincerely in love?
Oh, we're in love!

I love you truly, truly dear,
Life with its sorrow, life with its tear
Fades into dreams when I feel you are near
For I love you truly, truly dear.
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Will never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cos I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Somebody once asked
Could I spare some change for gas?
"I need to get myself away from this place"
I said, "Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change"
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

In every job that must be done
There is an element of fun
You find the fun and snap!
The job's a game
And every task you undertake
Becomes a piece of cake
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that
A Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down-wown
The medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
A robin feathering his nest
Has very little time to rest
While gathering his bits of twine and twig
Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song will move the job along - for
A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
The medicine go down-wown
The medicine go down
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down
In a most delightful way
The honey bee that fetch the nectar
From the flowers to the comb
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro
Because they take a little nip
From every flower that they sip
And hence (And hence),
They find (They find)
Their task is not a grind.
Ah-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h ah!

It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard
And this is how it goes
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

He traveled all around the world and everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say there goes a clever gent
When dukes of Maharaja pass the time of day with me
I say me special word and then they ask me out to tea

Now you can say it backwards which is
Dociousaliexpisticfragicalirupus
But that's going a bit to far, don't you think?
Indubitably
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay (oui, oui!)
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it can change your life
For example
Yes?
One night I said it to me girl and now me girl's me wife
Oh! And a lovely thing she is, too, ha ha ha
She's

Gosh, it disturbs me to see you Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favorite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why
No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
Who play cards like Gaston?
Who break hearts like Gaston?
Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston?
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy, that Gaston!
I needed encouragement
Thank you LeFou
Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you
Too much?
Yep
No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver
And beasts of the field say a prayer
First I carefully aimed for the liver
And I shot from behind
Is that fair?
I don't care
No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating
Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad, I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown, I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge
Who has brains like Gaston
Entertains like Gaston!
Who can make up these endless refrains like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating
Say it again
Who's the man among men?
Who's the super success?
Don't you know? can't you guess?
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on
There's just one guy in town, who's got all of it down
And his name's G-A-S-T
I believe there's another T
It just occurred to me that I'm illiterate
And I've never actually have to spell it out loud before

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads

My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says "Boy quit foolin' around"
I told her "I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry
And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine all mine
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love
Yes sway to the rhythm of love

Look at me, I'm a train on a track
I'm a train, I'm a train, I'm a chucka train, yeah

It's been a life that's long and hard

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We are just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours

He wasn't looking for a pretty face
She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV
She needed someone with an interior smile
She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
This is love worth waiting for
Something special, something pure
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
This is love worth waiting for
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
This is love worth waiting for
This is love worth waiting for
Bitterness will die for sure
Something special, something pure
This is love worth waiting for
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time
I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love

There was a time when there was nothing at al
Nothing at all, just a distant hum
There was a being and he lived on his own
He had no one to talk to, and nothing to do
He drew up the plans,
learnt to work with his hands
A million years passed by and his work was done
And his words were these...
Hope you find it in everything,
everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything,
everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you
So she had built her elaborate home
With it's ups and it's downs,
its rains and its sun
She decided that her work was done,
time to have fun
and she found a game to play
Then as part of the game
She completely forgot where she'd hidden herself
And she spent the rest of her time
Trying to find the parts
Hope you find it in everything,
everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything,
everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you
There was a time when there was nothing at all, nothing at all
Just a distant hum

I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind
Why should I mind, why should I mind
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me
Stand by me
Darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand
Stand by me...

Seventy six trombones led the big parade,
With a hundred & ten cornets close at hand.
They were followed by rows and rows,
Of the finest virtuosos,
The cream of every famous band.
Seventy six trombones caught the morning sun,
With a hundred & ten cornets right behind.
There were over a thousand reeds,
Srpinging up like weeds,
There were horns of every shape & size.
There were copper bottom timpani in horse platoons,
Thundering, thundering, all along the way.
Double bell euphoniums and big bassoons,
Each bassoon having its big fat say.
There were fifty mounted canons in the battery,
Thundering, thundering, louder than before.
Clarinets of every size,
And trumpets who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score!
Seventy six trombones hit the counterpoint,
While a hundred and ten cornets blazed away.
To the rhythm of Harch! Harch! Harch!
All the kids began to march,
And they're marching still right today!

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune, yeah
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life

Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds and seize the day
Minute by minute that's how you win it
We will find a way
But let us seize the day
Courage cannot erase our fear
Courage is when we face our fear
Tell those with power safe in their tower
We will not obey!
Behold the brave battalion that stands side by side
Too few in number and too proud to hide
Then say to the others who did not follow through
You're still our brothers, and we will fight for you
Now is the time to seize the day
Stare down the odds and seize the day
Once we've begun
If we stand as one
Someday becomes somehow
And a prayer becomes a vow
And the strike starts right damn now!
Now is the time to seize the day
Now is the time to seize the day
Answer the call and don't delay
Answer the call and don't delay
Wrongs will be righted
If we're united
Let us seize the day
Now let 'em hear it loud and clear
Now let 'em hear it loud and clear
Like it or not we're drawing near
Like it or not we're drawing near
Proud and defiant
We'll slay the giant
Judgment day is here
Houston to Harlem, look what's begun
One for all and all for one!
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
Oh! Strike!
Now is the time to seize the day
They're gonna see there's hell to pay
Nothing can break us
No one can make us quit before we're done
One for all and all for
One for all and all for
One for all and all for one!

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved
If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love
To dance with my father again
When I and my mother
Would disagree
To get my way I would run
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me
If I could steal one final glance
One final step
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
'Cause I'd love love love to
Dance with my father again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me
I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send her
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream

Did you see my little Jimmy marching with the soldiers up the avenue?
There was Jimmy just as stiff as starch like his Daddy on the seventeenth of March.
Did you notice all the lovely ladies casting their eyes on him?
Away he went to live in a tent over in France with his regiment
Were you there, and tell me, did you notice?
They were all out of step but Jim.

The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share
And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy he's my brother
He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother, he ain't heavy

Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves just like flies
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
Is he strong?
Listen bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead
Hey, there
There goes the Spider-Man
In the chill of night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame
He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out

Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
Oh... my unspeakable wife, Queen Lisa now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
And now I work at the Pizza Pizza
1 2 3 4!
Royalty, lord it looked good on me
Buried in silk in the royal boudoir or going nuclear free
Or playing Crokinole with the Princess of Monaco
Telling my jokes to the OPEC leaders, getting it all on video
Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
A palatial palace, that was my home now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
And now I vacuum the turf at SkyDome
Once he was the King of Spain
I can't wait, I'm lowering interest rates, my people say:
"King, how are you such a genius?
There's a roof overhead
and food on our plates!"
It's laissez-faire, I don't even give a care
Let's make Friday part of the weekend
And give every new baby a chocolate eclair
Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
Hey Clinton! Hey Yeltsin! Got problems?
You phone me now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
Now the Leafs call me up to drive the Zamboni
Once he was the King of Spain
Ladies and Gentlemen, I introduce to you the international orchestra!
Now some of you might be wondering how I came to be living in Canada
after being royalty in Spain. Should I tell them, guys?
Tell us, King!
You see late one night when the palace was asleep
Out of my royal chambers and into the garden I creep
And I wait till the appointed time, when the moon is lighting the pitch
At which point my peasant friend, who looks just like me
Arrives and we make switch!
Prince and pauper, junior and whopper
World made up of silver and copper
Under my own volition, I took a change of position
So next time you drool in the pizza line
Remember, slower pizza's more luscious
The King of Spain never rushes!!!
Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
I was lookin' for off-handed ways to improve us now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
And now I'm jamming with Moxy Fruvous!
Once he was the King of Spain

Ain't got time for messin' around

I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, momma rock me
I'm running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Hey, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, momma rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
Caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me
Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me (mama rock me, mama rock me)
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, ey yeah momma rock me (you can rock me, rock me)

Baby, why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred and fifteen channels of nothing but bad news on,
Well it might be me
But the way I see it,
The whole wide world has gone crazy.
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Just a little bitty living room ain't gonna look like much.
But when the lights go down and we move the couch,
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet
And our two hearts beatin'
Nobody's gonna see us go crazy.
So baby, why don't we just dance
Down the hall,
Maybe straight up the stairs?
Bouncing off the wall,
Floating on air,
Baby, why don't we just dance?
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on,
And those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on?
On second thought,
Just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy.
So baby, why don't we just dance
Down the hall
Maybe straight up the stairs?
Bouncing off the wall,
Floating on air,
Baby, why don't we just dance?
I'll cut a rug
Well it might be me
But the way I see it,
The whole wide world has gone crazy.
So baby, why don't we just dance
(Bouncing off the walls, floating on air)
Oh baby (baby) why don't we just dance?

You've got batman entirely wrong
John, we are all batpeople
Hank, Gotham never gets better for long
Crime is not actually caused by evil
We are all batpeople
Crime is not actually caused by evil
Batman's just a rich guy with an affinity for bats
Who's playing out his insane fantasy
How is that heroic?
Batman's values and actions are
A reflection of our own values and actions
To make the world better
Does Batman understand
How difficult it is
For an underfunded city like Gotham
To replace roads and bridges
We see ourselves in the cracks façade
In his anger and frustration
Because we have all those things, too

Crime is not actually caused by evil
We are all batpeople
Crime is not actually caused by evil
Crime is caused by systemic disenfranchisement
And poverty
And lack of access to job opportunities
We are not the heros earth needs

But the heros earth just happened to get

I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind
Blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
There's more I gained
'Cause it led me back
To you
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop
And see you here
I remember who all this was for
And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home (Yes)
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights!
From now on!
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight!
It starts tonight!
Let these promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on
From now on
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
And we will come back home
And we will come back home
Home, again!
From now on
From now on
Home, again! (Oooo uuuu)
From now on
From now on
Home, again!

You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies' a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake away
'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same
Come alive, come alive
Go and ride your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way
No more living in those shadows
You and me we know how that goes
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same
We'll be the light that's turning
Bottle up and keep on shining
You can prove there's more to you
You cannot be afraid
Come alive, come alive
Go and ride your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So, come alive!
Come one!
Come all!
Come in!
Come on!
To anyone who's bursting with a dream
Come one!
Come all!
You hear
The call
To anyone who's searching for a way to break free
Break free!
Break free!
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
(Hey!)
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So come alive! (Come alive!) (Yeah!)

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all, all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin', I love you
And I always will
Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin', I love you
And I always will
Love me tender, love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin', I love you
And I always will

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss girl
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
It's possible she wants you too
There's one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl (kiss the girl)
Sha-la-la-la-la-la

Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad
It's such a shame, too bad
You're gonna miss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl (kiss the girl)
Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl (kiss the girl)
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh my
Looks like the boy's too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la

I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face its harms
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

Ok, ok, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui: breathe it in!
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod!
When you're staring at a demi-god
What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey!
What has two thumbs that pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome!
To stretch the days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome!
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome!
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome!
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I can go on and on
I can explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground, oh
That was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?
What is the take-away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mini-Maui just tippity-tappin'
Well, anyway let me say you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome!
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away
You're welcome!
'Cause Maui can do anything but float
You're welcome!
You're welcome!
And thank you!
